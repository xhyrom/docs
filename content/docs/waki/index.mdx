**Waki** (WakaTime Integration Proxy) acts as a bridge for your coding statistics. It is a lightweight proxy server designed to forward heartbeat requests to multiple WakaTime-compatible instances simultaneously.

Built to run entirely on [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/), Waki offers a serverless, low-latency solution for synchronizing your coding activity across different tracking services.
