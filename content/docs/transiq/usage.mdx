## Accessing Data

All mirrored GTFS files are publicly accessible via the Transiq CDN.

<div className="api-endpoint">
  <span className="api-method">GET</span>
  <span className="api-path">https://transiq.xhyrom.dev/gtfs/:country_code/:feed_id.zip</span>
</div>

**Example Usage:**

To access the IDS BK regional buses data from Slovakia:
`https://transiq.xhyrom.dev/gtfs/sk/ids-bk_regional.zip`

## Contributing Feeds

Transiq is designed to be extensible. You can add new GTFS feeds by submitting a pull request.

1.  **Create a Definition File:**
    Navigate to the `feed` directory and create a new TypeScript file in the appropriate country folder (e.g., `feed/sk/new-feed.ts`).

2.  **Implement the Interface:**
    Use the following structure to define the feed metadata and source logic:

    ```typescript
    import type { Feed, FileSource } from "@feeds/types";

    export default {
      id: "unique-id",
      name: "Human Readable Name",
      license: {
        type: "CC BY 4.0",
        url: "https://license-url.example",
        attribution: "Agency Name",
        from: "https://source-website.example",
      },
      getLatestSource: async (): Promise<FileSource> => {
        // Logic to retrieve the latest source URL
        return {
          type: "url", // or "google_drive"
          url: "https://agency.com/gtfs.zip",
        };
      },
    } satisfies Feed;
    ```

### Automated Updates

The system utilizes GitHub Actions to automatically check for updates, download fresh data, and publish it daily. The processed files are stored in the [`gtfs`](https://github.com/xhyrom/transiq/tree/gtfs) branch of the repository.
