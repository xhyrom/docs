title: Introduction
description: GTFS Data Processing Toolset
---

**Transiq** (pronounced "transique") is a comprehensive toolset for accessing, processing, and publishing public transport data in [GTFS](https://gtfs.org) (General Transit Feed Specification) format.

This project originated from the need to handle regional bus data from Slovakia (IDS BK), which was hosted on Google Drive and difficult to access programmatically. Transiq solves this by mirroring feeds and providing a consistent interface, while being generic enough to support any GTFS feed.
