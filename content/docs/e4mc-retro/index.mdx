**e4mc Retro** is a backport of the [e4mc](https://modrinth.com/mod/e4mc) mod, allowing you to open your Minecraft LAN world to anyone over the internet — even on older Minecraft versions.

## Overview

e4mc functions as a reverse tunneling reverse proxy for Minecraft. In simpler terms, it acts as a bridge that temporarily exposes your local Minecraft server to the public internet, allowing friends to join without port forwarding or VPNs.
