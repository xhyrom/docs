description: Discord Rich Presence extension for Zed
---

**Zed Discord Presence** is an extension for the [Zed](https://zed.dev) editor that brings [Discord Rich Presence](https://discord.com/developers/docs/rich-presence/how-to) support to your coding sessions.

Currently, this extension utilizes the Language Server Protocol (LSP) as a bridge to communicate with Discord. While this is a workaround, a complete rewrite using Zed's native extension capabilities is planned for the future.

## Features

- **Rich Presence**: Display your current file, workspace, and language on Discord.
- **Customizable**: Configure what information is shown using placeholders.
- **Idle Detection**: Automatically change status when you are away.
- **Git Integration**: Show a button linking to your repository.
- **WSL Support**: Bridge connection from WSL to Windows Discord client.
